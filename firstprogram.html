            Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, 
            and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres above the surrounding land.

            Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, 
            through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
